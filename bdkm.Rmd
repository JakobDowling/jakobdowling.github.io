This companion site contains interactive maps related to the project *Tax Subsidies and the Cost of Homeownership: Evidence from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act* by Kelly Bishop, Jakob Dowling, Nicolai Kuminoff and Alvin Murphy. In the future, we will also provide a downloadable database of user cost rates and housing subsidies by PUMA over time.
